# temperature-scraper
Web scraper for scraping temperature, using python and playwright.
In this code, i have used Python3 version - 3.13.2 and playwright to automate the scraping.
I have used accuweather's webpage to get the value of temperature.
Also have used 'datetime' module to show the exact date and day name of one whose temperature is scraping.
